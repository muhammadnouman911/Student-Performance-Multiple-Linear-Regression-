## 🧠 **Machine Learning Models**

### **1. Multiple Linear Regression**
   - Predicts student performance by fitting a linear equation to the data.

### **2. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**
   - A deep learning approach that uses an interconnected network of neurons to learn complex patterns.

### **3. Decision Tree Regression**
   - A non-linear model that splits the data based on feature values to make predictions.

### **4. Polynomial Regression**
   - A flexible regression model that uses polynomial equations for a non-linear fit.

### **5. Random Forest Regression**
   - An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to enhance prediction accuracy.

### **6. Support Vector Regression (SVR)**
   - Uses support vector machines for regression tasks, known for its ability to handle complex, non-linear relationships.
